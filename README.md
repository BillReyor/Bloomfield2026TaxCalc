# Bloomfield Tax Calculator

This repository contains a single-page calculator for estimating residential property taxes in the Town of Bloomfield for fiscal years 2026&ndash;2029. It is written entirely in HTML and JavaScript.

The tool dynamically builds the yearly rate inputs from arrays in the script, so you can easily adjust the default mill rates without touching the markup.

2. Open `Index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Adjust the form fields to match your property information.
4. Click **Calculate My Taxes** to see yearly and monthly projections.

No build tools or server are required.

See [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md) for details about the calculation process and how to modify the default assumptions.
